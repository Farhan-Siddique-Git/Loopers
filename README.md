# Exploring Students Performance

**Project overview**  
This repository contains analysis and visualizations for the dataset **StudentsPerformance.csv**. The goal is to explore factors that affect students' performance in exams (scores and pass rates), discover patterns, and build simple predictive models.

## Contents
- `StudentsPerformance.csv` — dataset with student records (demographics, test preparation, scores).
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks with exploration, plots and modeling (add your `.ipynb` files here).
- `scripts/` — Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis or model training.
- `README.md` — this file.

## Dataset description
The dataset includes one row per student. Typical columns (adjust if your file uses different names):
- `gender` — male/female
- `race/ethnicity` — student group
- `parental level of education` — e.g., "bachelor's degree"
- `lunch` — standard or free/reduced
- `test preparation course` — completed or none
- `math score` — 0–100
- `reading score` — 0–100
